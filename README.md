# Cyclistic Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This project explores the Cyclistic bike-share program in Chicago. The main goal is to analyze user data to uncover key differences between casual riders and annual members. Insights from this analysis will inform marketing strategies to increase memberships.

## Data Source
The dataset is provided by the Chicago city bike program and can be accessed here: [Divvy Trip Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

## Key Business Objectives
- Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
- Understand how annual members and casual riders differ.
- Identify factors influencing casual riders to buy memberships.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Microsoft Excel

## Data Cleaning and Manipulation
- Downloaded 12 `.csv` files (e.g., `202101-divvy-tripdata.zip`) representing one year of Cyclistic ride data.
- Merged and cleaned datasets, removing duplicates and handling missing values.
- Standardized column names for consistent analysis.

## Key Findings
1. Casual riders tend to ride on weekends, while annual members use bikes throughout the week.
2. Average trip duration is higher for casual riders compared to members.
3. Membership promotions are likely to succeed by targeting weekend riders.

## Recommendations
- Offer discounts or promotions on memberships during weekends.
- Promote the convenience of membership for frequent weekday riders.
- Partner with local businesses to incentivize casual riders.
